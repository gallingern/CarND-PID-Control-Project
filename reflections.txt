Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

Proportional gain: causes system to react more quickly, but also overshoot
Integral gain: drives down steady state error, but can slow down system response
Derivative gain: allows system to anticipate error, adding damping and preventing overshoot


Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

Hyperparameters were chosen by manual tuning.  First gains were zeroed.  Proportional gain raised until steady oscillation achieved.  Derivative added to smooth oscillation.  Integral added to slightly stabilize.  Car still has a slight oscillation, but makes a lap around the track steadily at ~30mpg.
